I have proficiency in C++ and Python and find excitement in starting and completing new projects. I am always striving to improve and constantly seeking ways to enhance my abilities. I will be graduating in July 2025 and currently looking for full-time or contract opportunities in full stack programming.

As a computer science student, I derive pleasure from recognizing patterns and making connections. I have a deep appreciation for finding innovative solutions, whether they come from organizations, individuals, or businesses in diverse industries. My expertise lies in technology, particularly in the front-end domain. I am a determined learner who consistently aims to enhance my skills and knowledge to become the best version of myself.

Motivation and drive are integral to my personality. I frequently set goals for myself as I enjoy challenges and always strive for improvement.
